# Contact Management System

Using Google Sheets, now you can send email from your web page contact-us form. Nowadays, we have a lot of open source forms available on the internet. But the advantage of this is simple and secure (Here we're not sharing our contact-us form details to anyone).

Google Docs has always been a secure tool for creating and managing documents over the internet. So here we expose API and record details using Google Sheets script engine.
