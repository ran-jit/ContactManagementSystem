# Contact Management System

CMS is to send email from web page contact-us form details (i.e., name, email, contact number, etc..). Now a days, we've lot of contact-us forms available in open source market. But the advantage of this system is to integrate our own contact form to send emails via Google Docs using Golang.

Google Docs has always been a good all-round tool for creating and managing the documents. The system is to record mail contents and send emails using Google Sheets and Golang script.
